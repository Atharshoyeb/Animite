# Contributing
* PRs are more than welcome, if you plan on working on a new feature, please open an issue to make sure it's viable and worth our time.
* If you want to work on an existing issue, get in touch via Discord so I can loop you in!
* If you're looking for something to work on, see the `TODO` list in Android Studio for some low-hanging fruits.
* Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/G8wF7pjpya) server to keep in touch!

## Pull Requests and Commits
* Commit messages should essentially be sentences without periods; add the description if it makes sense to do so (sentence *with* a period). For example: `git commit -am "Commit message" -m "Commit description."`.
* Please add a PR description that clearly describes your changes, with links to relevant documentation, API references, etc.
